# simple-blackjack-game

* The Blackjack Game is a simple web-based game where a player tries to draw cards whose total value is as close as possible 
to 21 without going over. This game simulates a single-player experience against the rules of blackjack (not against a dealer).

# Game Rules

* The goal is to get a sum of 21 with your cards.

* An Ace (A) is worth 11 points.

* Jack (J), Queen (Q), and King (K) are worth 10 points.

* All other cards (2–10) are worth their face value.

* You can draw new cards to try to improve your score.

* If your total goes over 21, you lose the game.

* If you reach exactly 21, you win – Blackjack!

* You can reset the game at any time.

# Features

* Generates random cards using getRandomCard() function.

* Displays current cards and total sum.

* "Do you want to draw a new card?"

* "You've got Blackjack!"

* "You're out of the game!"

# Buttons:

* NEW CARD – draws a new card if you're still playing.

* RESET GAME – resets the game state.
